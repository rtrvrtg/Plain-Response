## Installation

Install this theme as you would any other Drupal theme.  
http://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes

To enable image styles for flexible images, go to the theme's Settings page and 
click the _Add Custom Image Styles_ button.  The image styles that are provided out of 
the box can be modified once they have been created, or saved as part of a Feature.

To disable image styles, go to the theme's Settings page and 
click the _Remove Custom Image Styles_ button.  The image styles can be re-created, but 
they will not have any custom changes you made.
