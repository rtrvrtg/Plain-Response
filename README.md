## Installation

Install this theme as you would any other Drupal theme.  
http://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes

To enable image styles for flexible images, go to the theme's Settings page and 
click the _Add Custom Image Styles_ button.  The image styles that are provided out of 
the box can be modified once they have been created, or saved as part of a Feature.

To disable image styles, go to the theme's Settings page and 
click the _Remove Custom Image Styles_ button.  The image styles can be re-created, but 
they will not have any custom changes you made.

## Implementation Details

### Theme-Specific Image Styles

This theme relies on custom image style being enabled.

The **theme-settings.php** file stores some custom form alterations for the theme settings 
form that creates image styles from presets when a button is clicked, and can disable them 
again when another button is clicked.

By default, the image styles scale the images to a given width, and don't allow upscaling 
to ensure that smaller images are loaded at their largest size.  (The images will be scaled 
by percentage later.)

### Flexible Images

This component allows images to be loaded at different resolutions depending on the 
size of the browser window.

There is a theme override for __theme_image_style__ that adds a custom, non-standard 
variable called **originalsrc** to the img tags that specifies Drupal's internal path 
to the file (eg. public://whatever.jpg).

The reason that this re-implementation is possible is that a new Drupal.settings 
variable set is created as part of a __template_preprocess_html__ override. 
This contains a few basic settings such as the site root, the theme path, the default 
file scheme, and the paths to any implemented stream wrappers.  (Drupal implements 
__public__, __private__ and __temporary__ by default, but modules such as 
[System Stream Wrapper](http://drupal.org/project/system_stream_wrapper) can add a few 
new ones that allow direct access to theme images, module images and so on.)

A JavaScript implementation of the Drupal API's 
[_image_styles_url_](http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules--image--image.module/function/image_style_url/7) 
function generates URLs from an image style name and an image's originalsrc attribute. 
The resulting URL points to versions of an image that have been converted to 
a particular image style.  The image's src variable is then changed to the new image, and 
the new image is dynamically loaded.

By default, the smallest image style is used to ensure that mobile devices are served the 
lowest bandwidth images by default.

This function is called whenever the browser is resized, so any images with an originalsrc 
variable are dynamically reloaded.  Same happens when the page is loaded.

### Why this implementation of Flexible Images

Since I developed this theme for a presentation, I didn't want to prevent the user from 
setting it up for themselves by making it hard to install.  I figured the .htaccess based 
approach a lot of other flexible image techniques use was too technical and esoteric to 
be accessible to a lot of theme developers.

To this end, I chose a method that was probably not the most ideal, but is probably a lot easier 
for people to get started with.  It still uses Drupal's standard image style API, and having 
all the functionality baked into the theme should make it a lot simpler for themers to get 
started with it.
